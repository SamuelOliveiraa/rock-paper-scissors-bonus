## WELCOME! ðŸ‘‹

This is a challenge proposed by the website **[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io)** and this site is great because it helps us improve our **coding skills** with real projects and more varied difficulties. The site gives us the possibility to train any skill or web technology that we want, be it media-querie, grid layout, Jquery, React, etc..

## The Challenge ðŸŽ¯

This challenge is to reproduce this **Rock Paper Scissor Bonus** as close as possible to the original design.

In this challenge I used my studies in React Js, Typescript and Styled-components to create this little game of rock, paper and scissors, despite looking simple, I brought two other moves to lizard and spock , bringing more difficulty and fun to this game than almost any other game. world has played. Any questions regarding how to play the rules will be in the application. Soon I will update it and bring new functionality
